        <h2 id="impact">Impact of Cinema</h2>
        <p>The impact of cinema on the 20th century was <strong>profound and multifaceted</strong>, shaping societies, cultures, and even political landscapes across the globe. Since its inception in the late <em>19th century</em>, cinema rapidly evolved into a dominant form of mass entertainment and a powerful medium for storytelling, communication, and artistic expression. In the early 20th century, silent films captivated audiences worldwide, transcending language barriers and offering a window into different cultures and experiences. The rise of Hollywood in the United States turned cinema into a booming industry, with stars like Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Buster Keaton becoming iconic figures. During times of war and conflict, cinema played a pivotal role in propaganda efforts, shaping public opinion and rallying support for various causes. The Golden Age of Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s saw the emergence of classics that continue to resonate with audiences today, such as "Gone with the Wind," "Casablanca," and "Citizen Kane." As technology advanced, the introduction of sound and color revolutionized the cinematic experience, further expanding its reach and influence. The post-war era witnessed the rise of independent cinema movements worldwide, challenging traditional narratives and pushing the boundaries of storytelling. The 1960s and 1970s saw a wave of groundbreaking films that addressed social issues, cultural revolutions, and existential themes, reflecting the turbulence of the times. Directors like Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, and Akira Kurosawa revolutionized filmmaking with their innovative techniques and profound storytelling. The advent of television posed new challenges to the film industry, but cinema continued to thrive, embracing new genres and technologies such as special effects and CGI. In the late 20th century, the globalization of cinema led to the emergence of new cinematic powerhouses beyond Hollywood, including Bollywood in India and Nollywood in Nigeria, further diversifying the medium and amplifying its impact on a global scale. Overall, cinema in the 20th century transcended entertainment to become a mirror of society, reflecting its triumphs, struggles, and aspirations while shaping the collective imagination of generations to come.</p>
